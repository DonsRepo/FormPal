## Abstract 
This algorithm compares a user’s ideal exercise motion to any new motion, giving them feedback to prevent injuries that occur with bad form. The project uses a Texas Instruments TM4C123GXL microcontroller and an Invensense 9150 IMU communicating via I2C protocol. It is intuitive and simple to use, requiring motion and the TM4C’s onboard button and RGB LEDs for communication to/from the user. It is intended primarily for upper body exercises because they have higher prevalence of injury. 
This project was motivated by experience weight training in the gym and dealing with the inevitable injuries that occur. Research showed that weightlifting injuries primarily occur when people are tired, because they lose proper exercise technique or “form”.  There exists a need for an intuitive tool to give external feedback to weightlifters when they are deviating from the proper form, so they can rest and avoid injury.
